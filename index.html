						<h2>Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Brief History</h2>
						<p>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence attempts to answer some of the biggest questions that has been ravaging the human conscience; whether mankind is truly alone in the universe, and how life begins on a celestial body. Since 1896, humans have been searching for contact beyond Earth. Although many of these ventures have turned up short, there have been many promising discoveries... </p>

										</header>
										<p>Nikola Tesla hypothesized that a wireless electrical transmission could be used to contact life on Mars. In 1899, Tesla had received a repetitive static signal. However, many agree that the signal was not extraterrestrial, but either a mistake using the new technology, or simply another signal from Earth.</p>

										<p>. Between August 21 and August 23 of 1924, Mars was in its closest opposition since 1804. By silencing the nation’s radio activity for five minutes every hour on the hour, scientists believed that a Martian signal could be found. Nevertheless, the three-day search provided no signals coming from Mars.</p>

									<p>Radio signals are searched for using the NRAO array. Scientists believe that a frequency equivalent to an excited hydrogen atom, 1420 MHz, would be the medium that extraterrestrial life would use to make contact, since hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. Therefore, scientists generally point the NRAO array towards areas of high hydrogen concentrations when searching for advanced interstellar intelligence.</p>

										<h3>The "Goldilocks Zone"</h3>

									<p>Among the thousands of exoplanets discovered since 1995, scientists narrow down the possible candidates for life by determining if the planet exists in the star’s “Goldilocks Zone”. The Goldilocks Zone is the perfect distance from the star to be habitable, or the distance that water can exist as a liquid on the planet's surface. For example, if the planet is too far away from the star, then water would freeze. If the planet is too close to the star, then the water would boil away.</p>

						<h2>Places for Prospective Life: The Solar System</h2>
						<p>Although the discovery of exoplanets has brought much excitement towards the prospects of life beyond the Solar System, it is also very likely that life, besides that on Earth, exists within the Solar System. </p>

								<h3>Mars</h3>
								<p></p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>Mars is a candidate that scientists and the public have deemed a suitable place to search for life. The study of Mars could better human understanding of atmospheric processes as well as the understanding of how microbial life can develop in different environments. There are many signs that Mars could foster life. For instance, the Opportunity, Spirit, and Phoenix missions to Mars had discovered water ice. From various orbital satellites and flyby missions to Mars, the discovery of ice caps on the Martian poles, as well as images of deltas and dried river beds, prove both the current and previous existence of water.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>The current existence of water and the signs of previous bodies of water show prospective signs that microbial life could exist on Mars. Many scientists suspect that microbial life could exist underground, or at the polar ice caps. Therefore, excavation missions and studies of Mars’ crust and ice caps could indicate whether life exists. The most exciting prospect of Mars to the public is the possibility for a human interplanetary venture, for studying areas that rovers and landers do not have the capacity for, such as Mars’ lava tubes.</p>

								<h3>Europa</h3>
								<p></p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>One of Jupiter’s more prospective moons, Europa, is yet another site for possible development of life. Europa is an icy oceanic planet with a rocky interior and a metallic core. There are a few factors that make Europa worth studying. One factor is its region of shifting ice-crust called the Conamara Chaos region. The region breaks apart, rearranges itself, then refreezes back into place. This process of ice movement is indicated by the many ridges observed in the ice covering this region. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>It is hypothesized that the gravitational effects of Jupiter on Europa results in this process, similar to how Jupiter’s gravity causes Io to be volcanically active. The most pertinent factor to the study of Europa is its induced magnetosphere. The existence of a magnetosphere implies that an ocean exists beneath the 200-kilometer ice crust. Such an ocean could be conducive to developing life. Therefore, NASA’s Europa Clipper will be launched in the 2020s to do 45 flybys to study Europa’s prospects in harboring life. </p>

								<h3>Enceladus</h3>
								<p></p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>Another candidate for life within the Solar System is Enceladus, Saturn’s sixth largest moon. This icy oceanic world could answer questions surrounding the types of environments that could cultivate microbial life. Between scientists, there has been a debate as to whether land is required to develop life, or whether life can be developed underwater in an oceanic environment. Some scientists have hypothesized that life on Earth began in the hydrothermal vents in Earth’s ocean, where it is hot and has plenty of nutrients and organic compounds for microbial life to develop. Life on Enceladus could prove the theory of life beginning in hydrothermal vents. The biggest sign indicative to life on Enceladus is the Cassini orbiter’s reports on the plumes that emerge from Enceladus’ icy surface. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>During a flyby, Cassini had detected water vapor, ice particles, and organic compounds ejected from once of Enceladus’ geyser plumes. Scientists believe that in studying Enceladus’ plumes would yield better results than if its ocean were to be studied. This is due to the process of “bubble scrubbing” in the plumes. When bubbles rise from the ocean floor, they carry organisms and organic materials with them. Therefore, by studying the plumes there would be a higher probability of samples containing microbial life. However, there are issues concerning how to collect and analyze samples using a robotic orbiter. By using an orbiter to fly through a plume to collect samples, there’s a risk that the satellite moving at high speeds might collide with and decimate the microbial life within the plume. There’s also the issue of developing instruments to image the microbial life within the satellite to send back to Earth for analysis. </p>

								<h3>Titan</h3>
								<p></p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>Titan- Saturn’s largest moon and second largest moon to the Solar System- is another possible place for life to develop. Cassini’s flyby of Titan revealed fascinating new discoveries about the large moon. For example, Titan has a dense atmosphere similar to the dense atmosphere of Earth, however Titan’s atmosphere is composed of nitrogen and methane. Titan also has a methane system that acts very similarly to the way water acts on Earth; an abundance of methane lakes, oceans, rivers, and rain exist on Titan’s surface. Titan has a very cold climate; its average temperature is -290 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>However, due to the Sun’s acceleration of the decomposition of methane and nitrogen in the upper atmosphere, hydrocarbons and other organic compounds exist on both the surface and the atmosphere. Hydrogen cyanide, one of the abundant many organic compounds on Titan, is hypothesized to be to be the origin of life on Earth. Hydrogen cyanide is the precursor to amino acids and nucleic acids found in DNA. According to computer generated simulations of Titan, hydrogen cyanide has also been found to create polyimine, a flexible organic compound that can create complex structures that could support prebiotic chemistry in Titan’s cold climate. </p>

						<h2>The Debate on TRAPPIST-1</h2>
						<p>. Due to the constant developments in discovering exoplanets, new systems such as TRAPPIST-1 have been heavily debated over the prospects of developing life. </p>
					</div>

				<div class="content dark style3">

								<h3>TRAPPIST-1</h3>
								<p>Through the discovery of exoplanets, many places beyond the Solar System have been debated as to whether they could contain life. The TRAPPIST-1 system, for example, has been subject to an enormous amount of debate. The TRAPPIST-1 is an ultra-cool red dwarf that is 39.5 light years away in the Aquarius constellation. TRAPPIST-1 is slightly larger than Jupiter, but with a much larger mass. TRAPPIST-1 is the host of seven Earth-sized terrestrial planets, three of them within TRAPPIST-1’s Goldilocks Zone. </p>
								<p> There are many optimistic scientists that believe that the TRAPPIST-1 system could cultivate life for several reasons. To start, TRAPPIST-1’s planets are all in close proximity to each other. This means that panspermia- the process of microbes transferring from planet to planet using space debris- can occur. So, if any life was able to propagate on one of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it’s possible for life to have transferred among the other seven. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>Scientists also argue that a TRAPPIST-1 planet with volcanoes that eject hydrogen on could increase its own chances of cultivating life. For example, if a TRAPPIST-1 planet was deemed uninhabitable because it existed outside the Goldilocks Zone, as the hydrogen ejected from volcanoes into the planet’s atmosphere, the greenhouse effect occurs, thus warming up the atmosphere and making the planet habitable. </p>
								<p>However, there are also many pessimistic scientists that list the numerous reasons as to why life couldn’t exist in the TRAPPIST-1 system. One of these reasons includes the amount of solar weather that TRAPPIST-1 emits. Since TRAPPIST-1 is a red dwarf star, it emits very large amounts of ultraviolet radiation and solar flares. The planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 are both in close proximity with each other as well as TRAPPIST-1 itself. Therefore, it is possible that the closest planets were exposed to enough radiation to lose any water that might have existed. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>Whether the radiation has burned off the planet’s water is yet to be learned. Another pertinent factor pertaining the existence of life in the TRAPPIST-1 system is tidal locking. Tidal locking is when the planet’s orbit around its star is synchronous to its rotation on its axis. This results in only one side being permanently exposed to the Sun while the other side is forever left in darkness. This effect can be seen in Earth’s relationship with the Moon, which is why scientists designate the Moon with a far-side and a near-side. It is quite likely that all of TRAPPIST-1’s planets face tidal locking. Since all seven of the planets are terrestrial, the heightened temperature difference between the far and near side on the planets could result in extremely high winds. Such an environment would not be very conducive to developing life, and thus the probability of life in the TRAPPIST-1 system goes considerably down. Even so, tidal locking of the TRAPPIST-1 planets has not been proven either. From an optimist’s standpoint, there is still a chance for life in the TRAPPIST-1 system. </p>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>The search for extraterrestrial life in has been a venture since Nikola Tesla’s electric signal experiment in 1896. Since then, more modern approaches to looking for life have used various telescopes and instruments both on Earth and in Low Earth Orbit. Various radio, optical, and laser signals have been both transmitted and sought out to indicate first contact with intelligent life. </p>
						<p>There are many good candidates in the Solar System for searching for prospective developing life. To list a few: Mars, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan are all viable candidates. The most exciting prospect about these candidates is that they can all be explored through unmanned missions. To date, there is still much debate over the existence of life in places outside the Solar System, such as TRAPPIST-1, the red dwarf star that hosts seven Earth-sized planets. </p>
						<p>The most frightening yet exhilarating part about this heated debate is that there is still so much that humans don’t know about developing life in other realms. It is very possible for life to evolve and develop in ways that differ from what is known. Until humans can expand interstellar ventures- both manned and unmanned- beyond what’s been done with Voyagers 1 and 2, nothing about life beyond the Solar System is certain.</p>
